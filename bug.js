This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing a keyExtractor function that doesn't return a unique key for each item in the data array. This causes React Native to throw a warning in the console and potentially lead to incorrect rendering or unexpected behavior.  Here's an example of incorrect keyExtractor function that violates the unique key constraint:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1 }, { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id} // Incorrect: duplicate keys
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.id}</Text>}
/>
```

This will lead to the warning `Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop` because `id:1` is duplicated.
